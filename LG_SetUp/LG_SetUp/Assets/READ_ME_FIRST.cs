This program is currently not running because the server that is used to for this game is out of action.

This game REQUIRES a server to work. the game is a location based game, in an attempt to better increase performance and game ability the locations for the interaction locations are stored on the server,
this was also a very limited number of locations included at this point in time.

The premise of this game is that there is a alien race that is taking over the world and all the players have to fight to resist and defeat them. this is done by taking points displayed in the map. It is muliplayer, that
is talked about below.

When the game starts it will check for the connection for the server, once the connection is made it will get the location data and will place them in the world at which point the user can "Tap" the location to trigger a
battle, this will take the player to a "mini game" where the player has to fight a top-down shooter to defeat the tower, if the player dies or wins they are return to the map screen and the result is sent to the server
once that node has a certan number of wins it will be deamed "Taken" by the players.
